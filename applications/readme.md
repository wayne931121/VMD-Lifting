Notice: because output position is all NaN in my test video, so I closed smooth vmd function to get correct vmd file.

SEE: 

```py
refine_position(positions_list)
``` 

in https://github.com/wayne931121/VMD-Lifting/blob/master/applications/vmdlifting.py

# What's New

## Smooth vmd with different smoothlevels

1. ```python vmdlifting_p.py "C:\TEST\testv\4.mp4"```
2. ```python test_p.py```
