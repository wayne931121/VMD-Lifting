# Notice

## If you use cpu, that's good.

## If you use GPU, 

### 1. set the memoey limit here:

https://github.com/wayne931121/VMD-Lifting/blob/master/packages/lifting/_pose_estimator.py#L19

### 2. check your tmp folder is all in ansi encode (all in english) (or tensorflow may give you a error)

If not, set here:

https://github.com/wayne931121/VMD-Lifting/blob/master/applications/vmdlifting.py#L19

## I turned off the smooth vmd function
